# Kirby Redirect

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1-green.svg)

With this plugin for [Kirby 2](http://getkirby.com) editors can create pages which redirect to its first child or any other page. You may want to have a look at the [Kirby Forum](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/editable-page-redirects/988?u=flokosiol) to get to know more about the idea behind it â€¦

## Requirements

Please notice that you need at least **Kirby 2.3** to use this plugin.

## Installation

Just put the `redirect` folder in the `site/plugins` folder of your Kirby installation. If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

There's a `package.json` file included if you want to use the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli).

## Documentation

Maybe I will add some more details here later :)
